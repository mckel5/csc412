When it came to the chat app, I went a little beyond what was asked and tried to implement some extra functionality for the HTMX version. I like doing web dev, so I took the opportunity to make it a learning exercise. It took a lot of combing through Crow's (IMO) pretty cryptic docs, but I eventually figured it out, and I'm glad I spent the time doing so.
