[partner] was always willing to offer explanations on parts of the lab I found confusing.
Her ideas for fixing the buggy code in the lab were straightforward and almost always very efficient.
I think we could have benefited from following the pair programming model a bit more strictly.

I could have spent a few extra minutes reading over the handout before our meeting, but I was still able to understand the instructions and start collaborating quickly.
During the lab, I researched some of the more complex topics involved, which I think helped us to understand what each question was asking and to write comprehensive answers.
